# conjgradexperiments
This repository contains scripts for experimenting with conjugate gradients of self-concordant barrier functions.

To replicate Table 1 in ''Computing Conjugate Barrier Information for Nonsymmetric Cones'', run `test_cgs.jl` using Julia 1.7 or higher
and refer to the output in `tex/iters.tex`.
